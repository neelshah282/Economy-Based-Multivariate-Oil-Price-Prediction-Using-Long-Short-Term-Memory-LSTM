# Economy-Based-Multivariate-Oil-Price-Prediction-Using-Long-Short-Term-Memory-LSTM-
Economic system-based multivariate oil price forecasting using LSTM. Model inputs include WTI crude price, USD Index, Gold Futures, 10-Year US Bond Yield, and S&amp;P 500. Data preprocessing removes outliers (2007-2009, post-2020). Results highlight LSTM's strong predictive abilities and the importance of macroeconomic indicators.
